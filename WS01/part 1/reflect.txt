WS01 Reflection

This workshop was in some ways both a refresher and an opportunity for learning new concepts. The main concept that was foreign to me was the idea of passing command-line arguments to the main function of the program after compilation. This is a handy method of making a program more versatile, and allows us to modify the behaviour of the program based on what is passed into the command-line once we issue the execution. In this instance, we passed the specific file names as the main()'s arguments to identify what is to be processed into the i/o stream. In addition, I also learned how to access a variable defined within another translation unit (external linkage. This was done using the extern keyword when defining a variable in the global scope. The rest of the workshop was a refresher for what I learned in the previous semester. The following are a few examples: using #ifndef, #def, #endif to guard a class from duplication in case the header file is included more than once, declaring local variables that last in memory for the duration of the program (static), allowing an incoming string to be allocated dynamically as a class's resource by using the string's length to do so, as well as effectively managing dynamic memory to prevent memory leakage.
